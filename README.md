# Machine Learning Models

This is a repository for the machine learning models I wrote

It includes: 
  - Logistic regression model
  - Linear regression model
  - Circle logistic regression model (it's just a demo of what happens, if you feed data into a logistic regression model that has a circle shape in a eucledian 2d coordinate system)
  - Neural network with demo
